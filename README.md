This is a project I've been working on for quite awhile now, its not functional in the way I intend for it to be yet but hey at least some of its there.
So the goal of this is to make a new human language based largely on russian and english existing words and then using spanish for a tie breaker when a russian and english word are unable to be "squished together" according to the code I made.
Once the program creates a new word using all three existing languages it'll store it into the new dictionary for future use. 
What the actual (usable) code will do is translate from any of those existing languages into the artificial one, change the words first according to the dictionary it made, then conjugate verbs as necessary taking heavy inspiration from english grammatical structures, then changing endings taking inspiration from the russian case system. 
So after a message is ran through the new grammar structure thing, it'll assign a custom alphabet that I'm making for it using LaTeX cause I made a 50 letter alphabet and I wanna use it, then it'll output as plaintext or binary or morse code depending on the users preference. 
Also I'm gonna put it on a rasberry pi so it'll kinda be its own weird little handheld translator for languages that don't exist yet :)
